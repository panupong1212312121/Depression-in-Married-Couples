# Depression-in-Married-Couples

This workshop is about analyzing Depression in Married couples 

I use data from this link 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/babyoda/depression-in-married-couples'

I try to show you the interesting insight that I get from this data below :

1. How are each feature related?

2. How to select the appropriate model and handle when you find some problem this may happen in this process (Imbalance data)

3. How to build and tuning models

4. How to find feature importance and handle when you find some problem this may happen in this process (no feature has significant impact on target response)

Example libraries which I use in this workshop : Scipy , Scikit-learn , Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib , Seaborn
