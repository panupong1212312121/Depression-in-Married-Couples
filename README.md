## **Key Learning Objectives**

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the relationships between each feature in the dataset.
2.  **Model Selection & Data Handling:** Learn how to choose the right machine learning model and address common issues like **imbalanced data**.
3.  **Model Building & Tuning:** Build and optimize predictive models to effectively identify depression risk.
4.  **Feature Importance & Troubleshooting:** Discover how to determine which features are most important for your model and what to do when no single feature has a significant impact on the target variable.
